				<h2>Characters</h2>
				<p>Courageous. Adventurous. Indomitable. These are all words Marlow Harvey can spell. And he knows what sixty-seven percent of them mean.</p>
				<p>Marlow doesn’t like Mondays – they’re one of his seventh least favourite days of the week – and it was on a Monday that two gorilla-sized men “encouraged” him to meet with Mr. Black, a reclusive property developer.</p>
				<p>And so began Marlow’s planet-hopping adventures on board the Santa Maria.</p>
				<p>Julia Lowe is both the Mission’s commander and the ship’s doctor. Enthusiastic and full of encouragement, she leads the crew through the chain of events that result in them leaving the Solar System and landing on an alien world.</p>
				<p>Mollie Sterling is a bit of an enigma. A mathematical genius from an early age, she lives in a world dominated by numbers, but largely empty of other human beings. Her work has involved the development of the gravity creation devices that make terraforming Earth’s Moon possible.</p>
				<!-- <p>Although at home in the four-dimensional world of space travel, she is as much a fish out of water as Marlow is when it comes to dealing with the rest of the crew.</p> -->

				<h2>Synopsis</h2>
				<p>It’s the year 2078 and Earth’s global population has reached ten billion. With accommodation in ever shortening supply, house prices are through the ceiling and into the overcrowded apartment upstairs. It’s a great time to be an estate agent and <a href="#section3">Marlow Harvey</a> works for one of the three biggest agencies on the planet. He should be drowning in commission but, unfortunately for Marlow, he suffers from a debilitating condition: pathological honesty.</p>

				<h2>About the author</h2>
				<p>Daniel has a degree in Computer Studies and loves new technology. He speaks several languages, English being the only one spoken by other human beings. He lives near the fictional town of Penbridge in the South of England and, a fan of all things meta, he is currently writing what he mistakenly thinks is a witty bio about himself in the third person.</p>
				<p>If you want to know more (although frankly it's unclear why you would, that all seemed pretty comprehensive) you can <a href="mailto:mail@danielpoore.com">contact him here</a>.
